# Quick Actions Implementation - All Star Signs Demo

## Overview

Fully implemented and wired up Quick Actions on the Dashboard (`/dashboard`) for:
- **New Quote** - Navigates to `/quote-builder`
- **New Company** - Opens modal with full creation flow
- **New Contact** - Opens modal with company association
- **Import** - Opens wizard for CSV/XLSX import with field mapping

All actions are accessible, instrumented with analytics, and integrate with a local data store.

## Features Implemented

### Accessibility
- All buttons keyboard-activatable with visible focus rings
- Proper ARIA labels and roles throughout
- Screen reader friendly (sr-only text, aria-live regions)
- Focus management in modals (auto-focus close button or specified element)
- Semantic HTML (form, label, button elements)

### Validation & Error Handling
- Client-side validation for all forms
- Server-side validation via data store (uniqueness checks)
- Graceful duplicate detection with user confirmation
- Clear error messages with field-specific hints
- Prevents double submissions with loading states
- Handles edge cases (empty files, malformed CSV, etc.)

### Analytics Instrumentation
- `quick_action_click` - tracked for all Quick Action buttons
- `quote_new_click`, `company_new_click`, `contact_new_click`, `import_click`
- Success events: `company_new_success`, `contact_new_success`, `import_success`
- Error events: `company_new_error`, `contact_new_error`, `import_error`
- `flow_cancel` - when user cancels a modal
- All events logged to console and stored in localStorage (`analytics_log`)

### Data Persistence
- Companies and contacts stored in localStorage
- Keys: `ass_demo_companies_v1`, `ass_demo_contacts_v1`
- Data persists across page reloads
- Event emission allows dashboard widgets to react to changes (future enhancement)

### Import Features
- Supports CSV and XLSX (max 10MB)
- Auto-detects field mappings based on column names
- Shows required fields with asterisks
- Preview step shows sample data
- Progress tracking with percentage
- Upsert logic (creates new or updates existing based on key fields)
- Error report downloadable as CSV
- Summary shows created vs. updated vs. failed counts

---

## Routes & Endpoints

### Frontend Routes
- `/dashboard` - Dashboard with Quick Actions (existing, enhanced)
- `/quote-builder` - Quote builder page (existing, linked from "New Quote")

### API Endpoints
**None required** - This is a demo using client-side localStorage. In production, you would create:
- `POST /api/companies` - Create company
- `POST /api/contacts` - Create contact  
- `POST /api/import` - Handle file upload and import
- `GET /api/companies`, `GET /api/contacts` - Fetch entities

---

## Database Migrations

**Not required for this demo** (uses localStorage).

For production with a real database:
1. Create `companies` table with unique constraints on `name` and `email`
2. Create `contacts` table with unique constraint on `email`
3. Add foreign key `companyId` in contacts â†’ companies
4. Add indexes on frequently queried fields

Example SQL:
```sql
CREATE TABLE companies (
  id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
  phone VARCHAR(50),
  website VARCHAR(255),
  address TEXT,
  created_at BIGINT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE contacts (
  id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  phone VARCHAR(50),
  company_id VARCHAR(50) REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  created_at BIGINT NOT NULL
);

CREATE INDEX idx_companies_name ON companies(name);
CREATE INDEX idx_contacts_email ON contacts(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_contacts_company ON contacts(company_id);
```

---

## Seed Data

**Optional**: Pre-populate localStorage with sample companies/contacts for demo purposes.

Add to `lib/data/store.ts` or call from a script:
```typescript
// Example seed
const sampleCompanies = [
  { name: 'Acme Corp', email: 'info@acme.com', phone: '+1-555-0100' },
  { name: 'Tech Solutions Inc', email: 'contact@techsolutions.com' },
];

sampleCompanies.forEach(c => createCompany(c));
```

## Running & Verifying Locally

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd all-star-signs-demo
npm install
```

### 2. Start Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Navigate to Dashboard
Open `http://localhost:3000/dashboard` in your browser.

### 4. Test Quick Actions

#### New Quote
- Click **"+ New Quote"**
- Should navigate to `/quote-builder`
- Check console for analytics event: `quote_new_click`

#### New Company
- Click **"+ New Company"**
- Modal should open with form
- Fill in "Company Name" (required)
- Optionally add email, phone, website, address
- Click **"Create Company"**
- Success toast should appear
- Check console for events: `company_new_click`, `company_new_success`
- Check localStorage key `ass_demo_companies_v1` - should contain the new company

**Test duplicate detection:**
- Try creating another company with the same name or email
- Should show warning with list of duplicates
- User can confirm to proceed or cancel

#### New Contact
- Click **"+ New Contact"**
- Modal should open with form
- Fill in "First Name" and "Email" (required)
- Optionally search for a company in the "Company" field
- Click **"Create Contact"**
- Success toast should appear
- Check console for events: `contact_new_click`, `contact_new_success`
- Check localStorage key `ass_demo_contacts_v1` - should contain the new contact

#### Import
- Click **"ðŸ“¥ Import"**
- Modal should open with wizard
- Select entity type (Companies or Contacts)
- Upload a CSV or XLSX file (sample below)
- Map columns to fields (auto-detection should work if column names match)
- Click **"Continue"** to preview
- Click **"Start Import"**
- Progress bar should fill
- Summary should show created/updated/failed counts
- If errors exist, download error report

**Sample CSV for Companies:**
```csv
name,email,phone
"Test Company A","testa@example.com","+1-555-0111"
"Test Company B","testb@example.com","+1-555-0112"
```

**Sample CSV for Contacts:**
```csv
firstName,lastName,email,phone
"John","Doe","john.doe@example.com","+1-555-0222"
"Jane","Smith","jane.smith@example.com","+1-555-0223"
```

### 5. Verify Accessibility
- Tab through forms - all fields should be reachable
- Press Escape in modal - should close
- Click overlay - should close modal
- Check focus indicators (blue rings)
- Use screen reader (VoiceOver/NVDA) - labels and roles should be announced

### 6. Check Analytics
Open browser console and run:
```javascript
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('analytics_log')));
```
Should show array of tracked events.

## Testing

### Unit Tests (TODO)
Create tests in `__tests__/` directory:
- `CompanyForm.test.tsx` - validation logic
- `ContactForm.test.tsx` - validation, company search
- `ImportWizard.test.tsx` - file parsing, mapping
- `store.test.ts` - CRUD operations, uniqueness checks

### Integration Tests (TODO)
Create E2E tests with Playwright/Cypress:
- `quick-actions.spec.ts` - full flows for each action
- `accessibility.spec.ts` - keyboard navigation, ARIA checks

### Accessibility Tests (TODO)
Use `@axe-core/react` or `pa11y`:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @axe-core/react
```

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
- No backend - uses localStorage only
- No authentication/authorization checks
- No CSRF protection (would be needed with real backend)
- No server-side validation
- Import limited to synchronous processing (no background jobs)
- Dashboard doesn't auto-refresh when new entities are created (requires page reload)

### Suggested Enhancements
1. **Backend Integration**
   - Replace localStorage with API calls
   - Add authentication middleware
   - Implement CSRF tokens
   - Server-side validation and sanitization

2. **Dashboard Live Updates**
   - Subscribe to store events in Dashboard components
   - Refresh widgets when `store:update` event fires
   - Or use React Context/state management (Redux, Zustand)

3. **Advanced Import**
   - Background job processing for large files (>1000 rows)
   - Real-time progress via WebSocket
   - Scheduled imports
   - Import history log

4. **Form Enhancements**
   - Auto-save drafts
   - Undo/redo
   - Bulk edit
   - Advanced search/filter in company selector

5. **Testing**
   - Full test coverage (unit + integration + E2E)
   - Automated accessibility audits in CI/CD

6. **Company Detail Page**
   - Create `/companies/[id]` route
   - Make "View" action in success toast functional

---

## Troubleshooting

### Modal doesn't open
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `ToastProvider` is wrapping the app in `layout.tsx`
- Check that modals are rendered (inspect DOM)

### Import fails
- Check file size (max 10MB)
- Verify file format (CSV or XLSX only)
- Check console for parse errors
- Ensure required fields are mapped

### Toast notifications don't show
- Verify `ToastProvider` is in `layout.tsx`
- Check z-index conflicts with other UI elements
- Look for console errors

### Duplicate detection not working
- Check that companies/contacts exist in localStorage
- Clear localStorage and try again: `localStorage.clear()`

---
