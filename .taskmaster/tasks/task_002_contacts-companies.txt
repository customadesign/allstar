# Task ID: 2
# Title: Update BaseLayout navigation to include Contacts and Companies tabs
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the BaseLayout component to add navigation items for Contacts and Companies, ensuring they link to the correct routes and maintain consistent styling in both desktop and mobile views.
# Details:
This task involves updating the navigation menu in the BaseLayout component to include new tabs for the Contacts and Companies modules:

1. Locate and open the file `components/layout/BaseLayout.tsx`

2. Find the navigation array/configuration (likely named `navItems`, `navigationLinks`, or similar)

3. Add two new navigation items in an appropriate position:
   ```tsx
   // Example addition to navigation array
   {
     name: 'Contacts',
     href: '/contacts',
     icon: ContactsIcon, // Use an appropriate icon from your icon library
   },
   {
     name: 'Companies',
     href: '/companies',
     icon: BuildingOfficeIcon, // Use an appropriate icon from your icon library
   }
   ```

4. Ensure the navigation items are properly ordered according to the application's information architecture (typically: Dashboard, Contacts, Companies, etc.)

5. Verify that the mobile menu implementation also includes these new navigation items
   - Check if there's a separate array for mobile navigation or if it reuses the main navigation
   - If separate, add the same items to the mobile navigation array

6. Apply consistent styling by following existing patterns:
   - Maintain the same component structure for each navigation item
   - Use the same styling props and classes
   - Ensure active state styling works correctly for the new routes

7. If there are any navigation-related tests, update them to include the new navigation items

8. Check for any hardcoded navigation counts or references that might need updating

# Test Strategy:
To verify the correct implementation of this task:

1. Visual Inspection:
   - Open the application in a browser
   - Verify that the Contacts and Companies tabs appear in the navigation bar
   - Confirm they are properly positioned in the navigation order
   - Check that they use consistent styling with other navigation items

2. Functionality Testing:
   - Click on the Contacts tab and verify it navigates to `/contacts`
   - Click on the Companies tab and verify it navigates to `/companies`
   - Test the active state styling by navigating to each route and confirming the correct tab is highlighted

3. Responsive Testing:
   - Resize the browser to mobile viewport dimensions
   - Verify that the mobile menu includes the new Contacts and Companies items
   - Test navigation functionality in the mobile view

4. Code Review:
   - Confirm that the navigation array structure is maintained
   - Verify that appropriate icons are used for the new navigation items
   - Check that no styling inconsistencies were introduced

5. Run any existing navigation or layout tests to ensure nothing was broken
